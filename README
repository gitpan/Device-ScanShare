Device::ScanShare 
===============================================
manage USERDIRTS.TXT ecopy file to manage scanner device options

ScanShare is a oo module to work with the USERDIRS.TXT file used by ecopy for use with 
their ShareScan software.
This enables you to control what the entries are via perl. 
You can add and remove entries to the file.

MOTIVATION:

We use ecopy and sharescan software in the office. This is so someone can step 
up to the scanner and scan to a predetermined place. They have a little touchscreen.. 
you punch in where you want to send it to, the name of the file, and voila. 
What you can select from is controlled via a file called USERDIRS.TXT. 
In it are entries like ;

   The Label=relative\dir\path,The Label,HostName,1,0

You can edit the damn thing in a text editor. If you have a jillion entries (like we have, 
upwards of 500), then you do not want to micro manage this by either using their crippled 
interface or via a text editor. Linux and perl to the rescue. 

Included is also a utility called sharescan that will let you edit the file via the 
command line. It is called L<scanshare>.
